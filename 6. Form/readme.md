# Working with Forms

Did you know that you can create forms using HTML (or your secret javascript-ninja DOM techniques) ? Some events are especially useful when working with forms. Here are several challenges, common use cases, that you'll have to solve using DOM events.

## Exercises

As always you should NOT edit the **index.html**, modify the [script.js](./script.js) file :
- Add a `keyup` listener on the first input field, so that once you type a letter in this field, it goes into the `<span id="display-firstname">`. The content of the field and the span should always remain the same.
- Add a `keyup` listener on the second input (the number input), so that if the age is below 18 the content of the section `a-hard-truth` remains hidden, otherwise show them this hard to swallow fact.
- Well this is a common one. Add a `keyup` listener on both fields and show a visual hint (for instance turn the input border red) , add a *validation*, if the password is too short (less than 6 characters) or if the password and its confirmation do not match. 
- Finally, use a `change` listener on the `<select>` field to toggle a dark mode on the whole page. For ease of use, we'll say that the dark mode is just turning the background black and the text white.

## Bonus

- Do the dark-mode using js to change **css variables**
- Add error messages if the input values doesnt pass the validation
